### Pending improvements:

-   Force strong password. Force unique usernames, no duplicates.
-   Refactor main.js - add event listener on parent element (then check what is clicked) OR use inline onclick attr in EJS (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35446496/how-do-i-pass-a-variable-to-inline-javascript-using-ejs-templating-engine/35446517#35446517)
-   Make app responsive (mobile)
-   Update data structure so unique users can have their own album list to manage.
-   On archive view, grey out archive button if it is currently being shown.
